# About Me

My name is James Mills (*also known as `prologic` on many places on the Web*).
I am a passionate Software / Production Engineer. I have strong verbal and
written communication, a wide array of interests, consider myself to a
"Jack of all trades" or all-rounder, a great mentor, teacher and tech lead.

### Brief history

I played with some of my first computers when I was ~8 years old
(*they were actually my father's*). My first computer was an XT monochrome
display laptop with 640KB of Memory, a 10MB Hard Disk, a 3.5" Floppy Drive
and ran MS-DOS 6.0

I wrote my first programs at age 11 in GW-BASIC, quickly followed by QBASIC
and then on to C and i386 Assembly. My first computer program was a game
I called "Lundo" (*one day I'll try to recover the source-code*). I wrote my
father's EE software assignment in Assembly for a Motorola MC6800 chip to
display the letters "C A F E" one at a time with a slight delay followed by
"CAFE" three times with pauses in-between.

Later on I discovered the Internet in 1997 and also IRC (*Internet Relay Chat*)
and have been an avid user of IRC since. I also wrote IRC Services for the
(*then*) Austoneline and 4-IRC Australian IRC Networks which at the time was
also adopted by some other networks.

I started working in the tech industry in ~2002 in-between semester breaks
while studying Software Engineering / Computer Science at
[Griffith University](https://griffith.edu.au) in Brisbane, Australia.

I've also been actively contributing to Open Source with many projects of
my own since the early 2000's, first on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net),
then [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and finally
[Github](https://github.com) where I now publish and maintain my public
proejcts and contribute to others.
