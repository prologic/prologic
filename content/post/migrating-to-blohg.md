I think I'll be migrating from [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/)
to [blohg](http://blohg.org/). The two Blogging engines both share very
similar functionality but the key differences that are attracting me to
[blohg](http://blohg.org/) are:

- Mercurial backed.
- WSGI Application

With these two key features I'll be able to better integrate
[My Blog](http://shortcircuit.net.au/~prologic/blog/) into
[My Website](http://prologic.shortcircuit.net.au) which is itself powered by
[sahriswiki](http://sahriswiki.org/) and
[circuits.web](http://circuitsweb.com/) and host my
[blohg](http://blohg.org/) powered blog using
[circuits.web](http://circuitsweb.com/)'s `Gateway` Component.

Kudos to the [blohg](http://blohg.org/) development team! I'll be giving this
a try on the upcoming long weekend.

Happy Easter
