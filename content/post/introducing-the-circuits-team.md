Lately [circuits](http://circuitsframework.com/) has seen some presence
in the wild and this is a good thing for the project. Just the other day
[Crunch.io](http://crunch.io) posted a job advert on the
[Python Job Board](http://www.python.org/community/jobs/) in need of a RESTful
Web Developer to designer and build their public API(s). Naturally I sent
them an email asking if they'd like to hire the lead developer of
[circuits](http://circuitsframework.com/) (*that's me!*) :)

I thought it was about time I setup a [circuits team
repository](http://docs.getpelican.com/) on
[bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) to make things a little more
prominent.

I've also setup a [circuits developer
group](http://www.wikicreole.org/) at [google
groups](http://groups.google.com) which commits and build failures will
go to and hopefully discussions amongst developers of circuits.

Anyone is welcome to join!

We're also on `#circuits-dev` on the
[FreeNode IRC Network](http://freenode.net).
