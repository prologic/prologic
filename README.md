Hi there 👋

I'm a DevOps Team Lead from Australia/Brisbane currently working for
[@AUCloud](https://www.australiacloud.com.au/) on building a "public-cloud"-like
Sovereign IaaS.

- 🗞 Check out my latest project: [fbox](https://git.mills.io/prologic/fbox)
- 🚧 I'm working on:
  - 📦 [fbox](https://git.mills.io/prologic/fbox) -- fbox is an easy to use
       and maintain distributed file system written in Go using Reed Solomon
       Erasure with FUSE and S3 interfaces and a modern Web UI
  - 📕 [Yarn.Social](#TBD) -- A decentralised social media platform based on
       the original [twtxt.txt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) spec/format.
  - 🔑 [Bitcask](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitcask) -- A embedded
       key/value store written in [Go](https://golang.org) with predictable
       performance, low latency and high throughput.
- 📖 Learning about distributed file systems and how to solve and make it
     simpler to deal with stateful services in an easy way.
- 🙋 Looking to collaborate on any projects that are simple, lightweight.
