## 10th July 2021

ðŸ“£ **FYI:** I went through with the decision to migrate all my code off of
            [Github](https://github.com) to my own private code hosting.
            See: https://twtxt.net/twt/jqlvb7a

Getting a 404 on some of your Go projects that depend on my Go libraries?

- Update any URI(s) from `github.com/prologic/<library>` to `git.mills.io/prologic/<library>`

Where `<library>` you depend on. Notable Go libraries that have moved:

- [bitcask](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitcask)
- [go-gopher](https://git.mills.io/prologic/go-gopher)
